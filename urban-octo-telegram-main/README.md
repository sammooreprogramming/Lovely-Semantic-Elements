# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Assignment Explination
This assignment is all about the optimization of code, or refinement and improvement of it. The concept holds that the best, most efficient and respected code is written by developers aware of industry standards and the demands of clients they are hired by. That is just whatI am to do in this assignment, and I am instructed to do so by using the proper hierarchy of elements, and the correct semantic tags within the HTML document.

### Debrief

A change from non-semantic elements in index.html to semantic elements was made by replacing the original "div" and "span" elements with semantic ones to allow for the program's aesthetic to remain the same. This method utilizes the requested semantic elements, and this allows for a larger potential audience to be formed via the internet's search engines being able to find the site easier.

I enjoyed learning about why the standards are the way they are and it made sense when I realized how much more readable the code was once i was done optimizing it. You know semantically.
