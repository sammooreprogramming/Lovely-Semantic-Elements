# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Assignment Explination
This assignment is all about the optimization of code, or refinement and improvement of it. The concept holds that the best, most efficient and respected code is written by developers aware of industry standards and the demands of clients they are hired by. That is just whatI am to do in this assignment, and I am instructed to do so by using the proper hiarchy of elements, and the correct semantic tags within the HTML document.

### Debrief
I enjoyed learning about why the standards are the way they are and it made sense when I realized how much more readable the code was once i was done optimizing it. You know semantically.
